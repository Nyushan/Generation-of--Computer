<h2>The generation of computers refers to the progression of computer technology over time, marked by key advancements in hardware and software. These advancements are divided into five generations, each defined by improvements in processing power, size, efficiency, and overall capabilities. Starting with the early vacuum tube-based computers, each new generation has introduced faster, more powerful, and more efficient systems. Over time, computers have become smaller, more accessible, and capable of handling increasingly complex tasks. This evolution has greatly impacted how we live, work, and interact with technology.</h2>
